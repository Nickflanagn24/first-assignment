## Planning
The planning of the Kick and Connect Football Camp website was a thoughtful process focused on user experience and brand identity. I began by sketching wireframe drawings to map out the layout of each page, ensuring that the site would be intuitive and easy to navigate for both parents and children. These wireframes helped visualize the structure, from the homepage to specific sections like registration and daily schedules. To create a cohesive and appealing visual identity, I used a color palette selector to carefully choose the brand colors. This step ensured that the website would reflect the camp's energetic and professional atmosphere, while also being visually appealing to the target audience.

*Lighthouse test


The Kick and Connect Football Camp website underwent thorough testing using HTML and CSS validators to ensure it met web standards and performed efficiently across different browsers. I used an HTML validator to check the structure and ensure that all elements were properly nested and free from errors, enhancing the website's overall functionality. Additionally, I employed a CSS validator to verify that the styling code was accurate and compliant with best practices. This process helped identify and fix any potential issues in the code, ensuring the website’s layout and design would render consistently on all devices. By conducting these validations, I ensured the website maintained a high level of quality and reliability.

In addition to using HTML and CSS validators, the Kick and Connect Football Camp website was tested with Google DevTools to ensure it was fully responsive and performed well across different screen sizes. I used the responsive design mode within DevTools to simulate how the website would look and function on various devices, from desktops to tablets and smartphones. This allowed me to identify and address any layout issues or breakpoints that needed adjustment. By testing across a range of screen sizes, I ensured the website delivers a smooth, user-friendly experience, regardless of the device being used.
