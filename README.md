## Planning
The planning of the Kick and Connect Football Camp website was a thoughtful process focused on user experience and brand identity. I began by sketching wireframe drawings to map out the layout of each page, ensuring that the site would be intuitive and easy to navigate for both parents and children. These wireframes helped visualize the structure, from the homepage to specific sections like registration and daily schedules. To create a cohesive and appealing visual identity, I used a color palette selector to carefully choose the brand colors. This step ensured that the website would reflect the camp's energetic and professional atmosphere, while also being visually appealing to the target audience.
